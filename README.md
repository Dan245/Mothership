# Mothership

Was supposed to be a 2D LAN Spaceship Deathmatch Game made using PyGame.  
Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish it. Now it's a window resizing simulator!
  
Key features:
- Window resizing and fullscreen
- Dynamic elements (Resizing, animations etc.)
- Multithreading
- LAN server implementation
- Custom-made, handcrafted UI Elements
- Smart event handling for a smoother experience
- Clean(ish) source code
- A nice GitHub page

My Final Performance Task for ICS3U1-01  
  
Stable build has all the relevent code files without the PyCharm IDE stuff
